Avalanche: The only website to find ski resorts.

## User Story

As a skier, when I open the page, it asks me for a state from a dropdown list

WHEN I click on the state that I want to choose, THEN it shows me the list of ski resorts located in that state.

WHEN I click on a resort, THEN the weather as well as the general info is stated on the page.

When I open the resort's page, the opening hours as well as general conditions are provided on the page.
