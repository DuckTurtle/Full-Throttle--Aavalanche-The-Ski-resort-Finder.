Avalanche: The only website to find ski resorts.

## User Story

As a skier, when I open the page, it asks me for a state on a search bar

WHEN I type in the state, THEN the options for the local ski resorts are displayed

WHEN I click on a resort, THEN the weather as well as the general info is stated on the page
